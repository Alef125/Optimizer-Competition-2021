# Optimizer-Competition-2021
My team's 1st rank experiences in an optimization competition.  
The competition rounds and questions could be found here in http://optimizer.math.sharif.edu/Optimizer2021.pdf,  
and our report published in arxiv could be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00819.   
Note 1: The optimization problem is based on some biological notions, a new variation FBA.    
Note 2: Our team, named "Panda", achieved the gold medal. Our codes are public at https://github.com/Optimizer-Competition-Pandas.
